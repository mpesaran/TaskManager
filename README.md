# Task Manager API

This is a simple Task Manager API built using **Flask**, where users can register, log in, add tasks, retrieve tasks, and delete tasks. This project serves as a demonstration of task management functionality, including user registration, login, and task management without authentication libraries (though authentication is considered in future steps).

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to register by providing a name, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in by entering their email and password.
- **Task Management**:
  - Add tasks: Users can create tasks with titles and due dates.
  - Retrieve tasks: Users can view their own tasks.
  - Delete tasks: Users can delete tasks that they have created.
